# coverage-test

A simple [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org) app using mocha/chai for unit tests.

The `HelloWorld.vue` component has been modified with an [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) example.
Optional chaining works in development, produciton, and the mocha tests.
